# exercismPracticeJS

These are my solutions to JavaScript practice problems from the open source project Exercism, available at http://exercism.io/. Exercism provides unit tests in Jasmine and I construct functions from the test suite and the details in the README for each problem. Here, I have included the tests and basic instructions **written by Exercism and not by me** in order to provide context for the scripts I've written.
